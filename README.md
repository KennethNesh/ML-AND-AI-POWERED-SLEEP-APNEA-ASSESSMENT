# 🛌 Sleep Apnea Risk Assessment with Gemini AI

This is a Flask-based web application that assesses an individual's risk for sleep apnea using a trained TensorFlow model. Users provide lifestyle and health-related inputs, and the model predicts their risk level (Low, Mild, or High).

After the prediction, the app uses Google Gemini to generate a personalized, markdown-formatted interpretation and advice based on the risk category. The interpretation is displayed with smooth animations for an engaging experience.
